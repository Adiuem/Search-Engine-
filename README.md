# Search-Engine
Specialized search engines can be better for specific searches because they have more structured content and offer higher precision than general search engines. Here are some examples of specialized search engines:
Kayak: Compares hundreds of travel sites instantly
DuckDuckGo: Uses information from crowdsourced websites to improve relevance and eliminates trackers
Wolfram Alpha: Answers factual queries directly by computing the answer from structured, curated data
Quest: Searches across the Law.com network of sites and the legal web
Bing: Specializes in natural language queries, meaning it responds to everyday language better than other search engines
Ecosia: Treats your data with more respect than most other search engines by not storing search information permanently, selling data to advertisers, or using external tracking tools
Dogpile: A meta-search engine that uses numerous indexes instead of just one to give a more excellent range of content than other search engines
Ask.com: A unique Q&A search engine that specializes in providing answers to questions asked in a natural way
Searchcode: Lets you look through more than 20 big places online where people share code, like GitHub, Bitbucket, and SourceForge
